## Run Server
```middleman server```

## Deploy Changes
1. Merge any changes to Master
2. From Master run ```be rake publish```
3. Boom! You're done! Changes will be live in a couple minutes.

## Troubleshooting Deployment
1. Delete `build` folder. If you have run ``be rake publish`` and it fails, there may be a duplicate folder in folder tree. Make sure to delete.
2. Try deleting you local version of ```git branch -d gh-pages```
3. Delete remote branch of gh-pages. ```git push origin :gh-pages```. *CAUTION: THIS WILL CAUSE SITE DOWNTIME AS SITE WILL NO LONGER BE SERVED FROM GITHUB UNTIL NEW BUILD IS COMPLETE.* It also may take a few minutes for the new site to go live.
